This is an ended competition I did in Kaggle.

Files:
- We have the data splited in 3 different files: trainingsetlabels.csv, trainingsetvalues.csv for training data and testsetvalues.csv for data to predict
- PumpItUpCompetition.ipynb is the main file where we have the code and the algorithms applied to get the best prediction. Each step and decision taken is explained throughout the code
